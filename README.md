Song rating web app with _"Tinder-like swipes"_ and pseudo-random song picking. <sub><sup>(working prototype, first time using react)</sub></sup>

A quick school project built with React, Mui, Typescript, Firebase and [Deezer API](https://developers.deezer.com/api).
Swipe cards are implemented using [react-tinder-card](https://github.com/3DJakob/react-tinder-card). Built for mobile-resolutions only.

> Live demo available [here](https://listen-pearl.vercel.app/), current firebase plan is on free-tier, rate limiting problems may (and will) occur.

#### In case you want to try it out locally
```shell

<sub><sup>I strongly suggest you connect your own firebase instance. Stupid firebase, had to use it.</sub></sup>
